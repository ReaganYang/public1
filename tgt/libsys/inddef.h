/*
    The Green Hills Software Libraries have been ported to many versions of
    Unix and other target environments, each with their major and minor 
    differences and conflicts.

    Every attempt has been made to isolate these differences into indOS.c
    and a few other files.

    At present, the following target environments and flavors of Unix are
    understood:

    Only one of the following should ever be set:
	    BSD                            \
	    DECMIPS                         \
	    DGUX                             \
	    NEXT			      \
	    SCOUNIX			       \  imply ANYUNIX
	    SOLARIS20                          /
	    SYSV                              /
	    SYSV40                           /
	    SUNOS                           /
	    __linux			   /
	    ANOTHERUNIX                   /
	    ------------
	    EMBEDDED
	    MSDOS
	    __windows
	    UNIXSYSCALLS
	    __VXWORKS
	    CHORUS
	    OSE
	    LYNX
    Variables in the first group are intended to represent various genuine
    Unix systems.  All of these imply the variable 'ANYUNIX', which is used
    to select the most generic features of Unix, such as directories with /
    and system calls like fork(), exec(), link() and unlink().

    The UNIXSYSCALLS variable describes a target environment which resembles
    Unix, but lacks the 'isatty' system call and does not handle signals.
    It was originally implemented for the i860 APX coprocessor
    environment, which emulates Unix under MSDOS and OS/2.

/*  MINIMUM_SPACE uses more compact code which is more appropriate for embedded
    uses.  Often this means dropping code which is only there for Unix 
    compatibility, or which is only relevant when we might use our libansi with
    another vendor's libc.a
    LESS_BUFFERED_IO is a specific space-saving change that makes sense in 
    embedded uses, but actually works on Unix as well.  It is almost always used
    together with MINIMUM_SPACE.  stdin and stdout are unbuffered by default.
    To recover the benefits of buffering, functions like printf and fwrite
    create their own buffers and flush them before exiting.  Thus, a call to
    printf or fwrite will probably only call write() one more time than if
    full buffering was in use.  putc(), however, always calls write().
    Internally LESS_BUFFERED_IO means:
    _io_buffering is ignored, except for 2 uses of _IOPBF (fputs and printf)
    _io_stdio_buffer is never set because malloc is never called.
