/* Constants to establish the size of the hash table and the

   The number of entries in the hash table is the size of the
   .text section divided by HASHDIVISOR.

   The hash function is the call source's offset into the
   .text section divided by the HASHDIVISOR.

   HASHDIVISOR should be a power of 2 and sized so a small
   number of call sources lie in each hash bucket
   Use an unsigned constant so division is a simple shift.

   Decreasing HASHDIVISOR will increase the hash table size
   and reduce the linked list searching needed for consecutive
   function calls that would otherwise hash to the same hash table
   entry.

   If you see the error "gcount: not enough arcs to record call graph",
   adjust these quantities to make a larger fraction, such as 1/8.

   If you see the error "gcount: could not allocate memory", adjust
   these quantities to make a smaller fraction. Most programs can
