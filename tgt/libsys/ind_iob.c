/*
    This file is included in every library module which uses FOPEN_MAX
    The value of FOPEN_MAX which is used to compile the library becomes
    a maximum limit at runtime.  On the other hand, the value of FOPEN_MAX
    in stdio.h is a minimum which MUST be supported on every system, unless
    we want to have different versions of stdio.h.  Some systems still
    allow only 20, but many systems allow 40, 60, 100 or more.  We would
    change stdio.h to a higher limit, but Plum Hall insists that FOPEN_MAX
    files can be opened, so for the sake of the worst-case systems, that
    value remains 20, even though the library is compiled with a much 
    higher limit and will allow the higher limit if the OS handles it.
