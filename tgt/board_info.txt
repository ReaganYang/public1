Flashing a program to the MPC563x board 
====================================== 

To program the internal flash memory on the MPC563x, the RAM base address 
must be set to 0x40000100. In the flash dialog, enter this address in the 
RAM base text field. If programming using the flash burn command, append 
-rambase=0x40000100 to the command line.
